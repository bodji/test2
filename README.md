$ tar xvf plik-1.0-RC4.tar.gz
$ cd plik-1.0-RC4/server
$ ./plikd
```
Et voil√† ! You have how a fully functionnal instance of plik ruuning on http://127.0.0.1:8080. You can edit server/plikd.cfg to adapt the params to your needs (ports, ssl, ttl, backends params,...)

##### From sources
For compiling plik from sources, you need a functionnal installation of Golang, and npm installed on your system.

First, get the project and libs via go get
```sh
$ go get github.com/root-gg/plik/server
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/root-gg/plik/
```

As root user you need to install grunt, bower, and setup the golang crosscompilation environnement :
```sh
$ sudo -c "npm install -g bower grunt"
$ sudo -c "client/build.sh env"
```

And now, you just have to compile it
```sh
$ make build
$ make clients
```

### API
Plik server expose a RESTfull API to manage uploads and get files :

Managing uploads :
   - POST        /upload
   - GET         /upload/{uploadid}

Managing files :
   - POST        /upload/{uploadid}/file             (request must be multipart, with a part named "file" for file data)
   - GET/HEAD    /upload/{uploadid}/file/{fileid}    (head request just print headers, it does not count as a download (for oneShot uploads))
   - DELETE      /upload/{uploadid}/file/{fileid}    (only works if upload has "removable" option)

Nice links :
   - GET/HEAD    /file/{uploadid}/{fileid}/{filename}
   - GET         /file/{uploadid}/{fileid}/{filename}/yubikey/{yubikey}


Examples :
```sh
Create an upload (in the json response, you'll have upload id and upload token)
$ curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:8080/upload

Create a OneShot upload
$ curl -X POST -d '{ "OneShot" : true }' 127.0.0.1:8080/upload

Upload a file to upload
$ curl -X POST --header "X-UploadToken: M9PJftiApG1Kqr81gN3Fq1HJItPENMhl" -F "file=@test.txt" 127.0.0.1:8080/upload/IsrIPIsDskFpN12E/file

Get headers
$ curl -I 127.0.0.1:8080/file/IsrIPIsDskFpN12E/sFjIeokH23M35tN4/test.txt
